# Counter App

A simple counter application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows the user to increment, decrement, and reset the counter value.

## Features

- **Increment Button**: Increases the counter value by 1.
- **Decrement Button**: Decreases the counter value by 1 (will not go below 0).
- **Reset Button**: Resets the counter value back to 0.

## Demo

## How It Works

- The app consists of three buttons: one for increasing the counter (`+`), one for decreasing it (`-`), and a reset button to set the counter value back to 0.
- The counter is displayed in a large font in the center of the app interface, with smooth visual updates every time the value changes.
